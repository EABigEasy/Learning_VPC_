Step 1 :Set up an IAM user
Security reasons, recommended by AWS to not use root account to avoid security breaches, So Root stays secured.
For Example. User =SamSon , Allow MAnagement console access, and generate password.

Set Permissions, best practice is to add policies to IAM group, then add user to IAM Group to avoid multiple attempts to create policies.
Download CSV to a secure folder and open to use link to account.

Step 2: Set up IDE. 
Integrated Development Environment is a tool, Developers write code, debug, manage, test code.

most IDEs are downloaded e.g Microsoft Visual studio code.
Note  AWS CLoud9 is  now deprecated. 

You can create EC2 and login via cloudshell.

EC2  becomes our environment.
Environment is the key to build an application.
so many application will use Many environments.
1 Environment to 1 Application.

Step 3. 
Install Maven & Java.

 What is Apache Maven?
Apache Maven is a powerful tool that automates the building of software.

Building is an important multi-step process that transforms code written by developers (like you!) into a final product that is ready for computers to run. The key steps typically include:

1. Compiling: converting your code written in programming languages like Java into machine code that a computer can execute directly.
2. Linking: combining the compiled machine code with additional dependencies (i.e. external resources required for your application to function) to create a single program for the computer to run all together.
3. Packaging: assembling your file into a packaged form. For Java projects (which is what we're doing), this would be a JAR (Java Archive Resource) file that you'll learn more about in Project 3 of this DevOps Series. This JAR file makes your program easily distributed or deployed in other environments.
4. Testing: running automated tests to make sure your software works without bugs or issues.
