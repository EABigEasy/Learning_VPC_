Creating a Private Subnet

Unlike a Public subnet that can be reached, Public subnet can receive requests after configuring IGW, Route Tables, and Subnet assocuatuons.
You want to keep it private, unaccesible from the internet and resources in the private subnet secured.

### You create a sbunet, Private Route tables, private NACL rules and its not ocnnected to IGW.

Understand NACL AND SG.
S.G security groups operate at resource level while NACL operatesat subnet level.

Avoid CIDR overlap.  while creating PRivate subnet you also need to create private route tables.
