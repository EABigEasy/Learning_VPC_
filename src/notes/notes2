VPC Traffic flow + Security
Create VPC, CIDR= 10.0.0.0/16
create subnets, Private and public. CIDR =10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/32

In a public Subnet, underf actions, edit subnet, Enable auto-assign public IP address.

Create Route tables- That's how resources know their way to the internet.
Note every VPC has default Subnet, default Route table (Also called Main route).
you can edit subnet associations in the main

A Public Subnet is a subnet with a route in the route table that is connected to the internet gateway that connects to the public.

Destination is Ipv4 CIDR block address that traffic in MY VPC. 
Target : is the road/path traffic will use to get to destination


Security Group is security on a Resource level
Understand Protocols and sources. e.g http =80, https =443, ssh =22, ftp =21, MYSQL/Aurora =3306
i.e for Inbound rules, HTTP, HTTPS  and 0.0.0.0 source means  inbound traffic froma ll IPs are allowed to access resource.

While for Outbound rule, Allow all means all outbound traffic is allowed.
E.g My WebApp requesting data from  public source.
Outbound rule by default all outbound traffic is allowed. 

NACL
 Set Higher level /Broad Traffic rules at the Subnet level.

There are Inbound rules and Outbound rules
